description: "I wanted a way to colorize the background of Todoist's Agenda view. That way I could quickly get a glance of the 'time period' of my day like 'Sleep', 'work', 'Family Time' etc. Todoist does not have this feature yet, so I made a chrome extension that injects css into the page and sets the colors to my schedule."

I wanted a way to colorize the background of Todoist's Agenda view. That way I could quickly get a glance of the "time period" of my day like "Sleep", "work", "Family Time" etc. Todoist does not have this feature yet, so I made a chrome extension that injects css into the page and sets the colors to my schedule.
