Flow State is a quick side project I built to help me stay "in the zone" When working with multiple monitors. The purpose is simple, you can have multiple instances of the web app open (one for each unused monitor) the instances of Flow State fill the unused space to both limit distraction and remind you of your current focus point. When an instance is updated to a new focus point, all other instances will update.
