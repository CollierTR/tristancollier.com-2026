description: "Bloodhound is an OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tool directory. This was my first personal project. I plan on rewriting it in React soon. I would love to start integrating my own OSINT script into it and making it a desktop application. Law Enforcement and Anti-trafficking groups use OSINT tools for inline investigation. I would love to one day build the 'Excel' of OSINT tools!"
